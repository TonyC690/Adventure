                Nexus requested to go on this mission not because he is willing to help but he wants to go back to his own planet Mercury. He landed here 2 years ago and has been planning to go back home but no sort of tranportation at all. This mission allowed him to go back and so he took advantage of this mission. After landing on Mercury he quickly transformed back into his orginal form, but accidently hurt himself and left a trail of blood. He was planning on packing his belongings but you came to find him right after and so quickly fled and trails of blood behind. If you havent guessed yet from the ceremony; he was the King of these creatures called Nexians. After finding out that you know who he is, he wanted to burn both you and Bob alive, but the rock that dropped was actually a special rock that proved leadership. (So technically you could have claimed yourself as King, but hahahah😂 didn't give you that option). Anyways he was gratified and allowed you to return safely with Bob.
